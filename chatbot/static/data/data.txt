# Siemens' Center of Excellence:
```
    Siemens Industry Software India Pvt. Ltd. (SISW), a wholly owned subsidiary of Siemens Product Lifecycle Management Software Inc., recently signed an agreement with the State of Andhra Pradesh Skill Development Corporation for the establishment of six Centers of Excellence (COEs) and thirty Technical Institutes across the state. The agreement was signed jointly by SISW and their partner, DesignTech Systems Ltd. (DesignTech) on 30th June 2015 at the APSSDC Office, Hyderabad.
    The six COEs will address diverse industry segments like Automotive, Industrial machinery, Industrial automation, Aerospace & defense, and Shipbuilding. The collaboration will train students on relevant industry processes and help create industry-ready trained personnel. This industry-readiness and relevance of skills will attract better career opportunities for students and will eventually foster further industrial development in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The COEs are unique in their ability as they will be able to stitch together the virtual world of engineering and manufacturing simulation with the physical world of product development and manufacturing.
    Equipped with the latest PLM software solutions from Siemens PLM Software, such as NXTM software for digital product engineering, Teamcenter® software for digital lifecycle management and Tecnomatix® software for digital manufacturing, and state-of-the-art industrial automation equipment from Siemens Industry these COEs will have the latest computer numerical controllers (CNC), programmable logic controllers (PLC), computer integrated manufacturing units (CIM) comprising of CNC milling and turning machines, automated guided vehicles (AGV), industrial robots, automatic storage and retrieval systems, vision inspection systems for quality control, CIM controllers and software and rapid prototyping machines. All the software is integrated using the Siemens Total Integrated Automation (TIA) portal, and each of the COEs will have seven fully equipped laboratories staffed with instructors trained and certified by SISW.
    In addition to the 6 COEs, to cater to the dual need of percolating industry knowledge throughout the technical skill supply chain as well as catering to various levels of job requirements that exist in this ecosystem, a unique hub & spoke model is developed where the COEs cater to the white collar requirements and t-SDIs focus on the grey & blue collar spectrum. These 30 technical-Skill Development Institutes training centers are focused on skilling students in vocational trades – Automotive, Electrician, Electronics, Manufacturing & Fabrication, and Agro & Farm machineries, at Polytechnic/ ITI level. These centers are built with industry partnership with companies like Mahindra First Choice for Automotive, Schneider for Electrical, HCL for Electronics, LMW for Manufacturing, ESAB for Welding and John Deere for Agriculture.

    ## Open Technology Platform: Scalable, Modular & Independent:
    ```
        The Open technology is scalable, modular and Independent. The centers can be expanded to incorporate latest technologies as and when the new technologies and developed and available. These centers are technologically independent.
    ```

    ## Self-learning Interactive modules – DIAS based (Digitally Advanced Interactive System):
    ```
        This model being digital, can be extended to the SDC level. It is hence incomparable coverage for the masses and grass roots.
    ```

    ## Unique and Advanced Hub & Spoke Delivery Model:
    ```
        The hub and spoke approach make it possible to get a large scale deployment and scale-up possibility with minimum time and investment. It also optimally leverages the physical infrastructure to cover as much territory as possible. These centers act as a foundation for adding other courses, collaborators, partners as per the need of AP, India and also globally. The spokes (t-SDI) are connected to the hubs (COE) for learning assistance and advanced lab infrastructure. These spokes are further linked to the SDCs to provide reach to district and village level students. This Hub and spoke model reaches one level deeper than the previous only “COE model”, which has been developed in various other states of India. “COEs” are focused to skill students for relevant growth industries – Automotive, Aerospace & Defense, Industrial Machineries, and Shipbuilding, at competent Engineering Colleges, whereas “t-SDIs” are focused on skilling students in vocational trades – Automotive, Electrician, Electronics, Manufacturing & Fabrication, and Agro & Farm machineries, at Polytechnic/ ITI level. COEs (Centers of Excellence) are created as advanced knowledge centres in Engineering Colleges with focus on student training, R&D, conducting industry sessions, etc. They will act as hubs for a set of t-SDIs. t-SDIs (technical-Skill Development Institutes) are designed to train students on technical and vocational trades at polytechnic/ ITI levels. Each COE hub will be linked with 5 unique t-SDIs with a combination of three trades in each one of them. SDCs (Skill Development Centres) are local e-enabled centres that will access digital content available with COEs and t-SDIs to help spread beginner level vocational skills across AP.
    ```

    ## Industry Relevant, Self -Sustaining Platform:
    ```
        This is an industry relevant academic program. Any new technology additions and refreshes as per industry needs are easily incorporated in minimum time. The model is self sustaining. It is prime funded but operationally sustainable. These centers are being developed on a “Built – Operate – Transfer” model. The complete setup will be transferred relevant institutions/ bodies post 3 years. An additional 1 year of supervisory and subject matter expertise will also be provided to APSSDC.
    ```

    ## Global Relevance:
    ```
        The world needs Technically Skilled workforce and India has a unique advantage of having 47 million surplus manpower in 2020. India has another advantage of the “demographic bulge” occurring at age bracket of 15–29. India has world’s largest population in this age bracket. If “adequately skilled”, India can fulfill the skilled labour deficit of developed world (~50 million). These courses are being developed after research of various vocational courses available internationally (in particular: Germany, Singapore, South Africa and Korea). The latest skills required in international markets have been incorporated into the already extensive courses available in India.
