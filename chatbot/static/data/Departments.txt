# Electronics and Communication Engineering - (ECE):
```
    ## About:
    ```
        The department of Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) was established during the inception of the institute in 2007 with an annual intake of 60 students. In the academic year 2009-2010 the intake capacity rose to 120 and in the year 2013-2014 it rose to 180.The department has a faculty student ratio of 1:15 as per AICTE norms .The average teaching experience is more than 5 years. So far around 2000 students have graduated. Every year our students secure placements in reputed companies like INFOSYS, TCS, TECH MAHINDRA, EFFTRONICS and VEDA IIT etc.
        The department also offers two post graduate programs in VLSI& Embedded systems and Digital Electronics and Communication Systems (DECS) with an intake of 18 in each specialization. The major goal of the department of ECE is to produce highly knowledgeable, competent and resourceful young engineers who can perform well in a wide variety of job profiles. To achieve this goal the department is putting dedicated efforts in nurturing a strong foundation both in analytical and technological aspects laid down in the curriculum. It also provides ample opportunities to students to work on mini projects, develop communication skills, explore internship opportunities in industry and take part in national and international design contests.
        The laboratory practical classes are conducted in a systematic manner, where complete plan is given at the time of commencement of the semester. The laboratories are well equipped with modern training facilities that cater to the requirements of the university syllabus. This department plays a vital role in training students of other branches of engineering too.
        The department also encourages students to take up Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineers (GATE), Graduate Record Examination (GRE) during their final year so they can pursue their higher education either in India or countries like USA, UK, Canada, Australia etc.The department has an active ECE students’ forum where students learn to do projects and organize technical events like symposiums, paper presentations to inculcate a broader perceptive on the profession. These efforts have culminated in the form of placements in various leading industries and organizations.

In this project energy captured by the wind turbine is converted in to kinetic energy which is again converted into electrical energy with the help of PMSG. This electrical ac output is converted into dc by using rectifier. The dc output of rectifier is fed to the buck converter which produces 24V dc output which is stored in battery. 24V dc output of battery is converted into ac output by using inverter and transformer. Here two stages of conversion is done as the speed of wind and PMSG is not constant.
