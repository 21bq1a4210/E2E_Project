        The Trust also aims to promote and foster education among socially backward and economically poor strata of the society by conferring scholarship to poor and deserving students in the form of financial grants to pay their tuition fees and other educational expenses.
        To realize the above objectives, as a first step, the Social Education Trust instituted Vasireddy Venkatadri Institute of Technology in 2007 with an intake of 240 students and 40 teaching and non teaching staff in a 12 acre campus amid lush green fields in a completely rural environment in Nambur village in Guntur district. By 2021, the number of students studying at the college has risen to 6000 and the Trust has already created employment directly to over 500 and indirectly to more than 1000 persons.
